  <h2>Early years, Nnadi grew up in Africa. Nigeria, to be specific. He mainly grew up in the city, but it’s not like any traditional American cities as you see here. He stated, "that it's definitely a lot more chaotic and not organized at all." Early years, maybe early memories, He remembers every holiday, especially Christmas. He would go back to the village with his family. They would convene, spend time with their immediate and extended family. And the village was exactly that. It is communities in the middle of the forest. "And that was fun," he stated.<h2>  </p>

    <p>
 He got to UCSB, did poli-sci there for a "fun" four years. And you know, poli-sci for the most part, it’s absolutely useless. He doesn't recommend that anyone learn it unless you’re doing political philosophy, then it’s pretty exciting. But anything else is just your own opinion, and that’s literally all poli-sci was.
